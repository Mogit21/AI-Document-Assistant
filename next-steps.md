1️⃣ Add a Streamlit Dashboard 🎛️
What does this mean?
A Streamlit dashboard is a simple web UI that allows users to:
✅ Upload PDFs/CSVs
✅ View extracted text and processed data
✅ Interact with the AI chatbot

This makes your project more user-friendly, rather than relying on API calls.

How to Implement It?
📌 Step 1: Install Streamlit
Run this command in your project folder:
''' sh
pip install streamlit
'''
📌 Step 2: Create dashboard.py in the root folder

'''python
import streamlit as st
import requests

API_URL = "http://127.0.0.1:8000"

st.title("📄 AI Document Assistant")

# File Upload
uploaded_file = st.file_uploader("Upload a PDF or CSV", type=["pdf", "csv"])

if uploaded_file:
    files = {"file": uploaded_file.getvalue()}
    if uploaded_file.name.endswith(".pdf"):
        response = requests.post(f"{API_URL}/upload/pdf/", files=files)
    else:
        response = requests.post(f"{API_URL}/upload/csv/", files=files)

    st.write("Extracted Data:", response.json())

# Chatbot Interface
st.subheader("💬 Ask a Question")
query = st.text_input("Enter your query:")
if st.button("Ask"):
    response = requests.get(f"{API_URL}/chat/", params={"query": query})
    st.write("🤖 AI Response:", response.json()["response"])
'''

📌 Step 3: Run the Streamlit App

'''sh   streamlit run dashboard.py   '''

👉 This will open a web UI in your browser where you can upload files and chat with the AI!


2️⃣ Deploy to VPS using Docker Compose 🚀
What does this mean?
A VPS (Virtual Private Server) allows you to host your API and chatbot online so others can access it.
To manage multiple services (FastAPI, Qdrant, Ollama) in one deployment, we use Docker Compose.

How to Implement It?
📌 Step 1: Install Docker & Docker Compose on VPS

'''sh    sudo apt update && sudo apt install docker docker-compose -y
'''
📌 Step 2: Create docker-compose.yml in the project root

'''yaml    version: "3.8"

services:
  app:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
    depends_on:
      - qdrant
      - ollama

  qdrant:
    image: qdrant/qdrant
    ports:
      - "6333:6333"

  ollama:
    image: ollama/ollama
    ports:
      - "11434:11434"
'''

📌 Step 3: Deploy to VPS
Upload your project to the VPS and run:

'''sh    docker-compose up -d --build   '''

👉 Now your API, Qdrant, and Ollama AI chatbot will be running online! 🌍


3️⃣ Improve Chatbot Accuracy using LLM Fine-Tuning 🤖
What does this mean?
Right now, the chatbot uses a pre-trained GPT model. However, it's not trained specifically on your documents.
Fine-tuning means training the AI on your data so it gives better answers.

How to Implement It?
📌 Step 1: Collect Data for Fine-Tuning
Create a CSV file (training_data.csv) with two columns:

Prompt: The user’s question

Response: The correct AI-generated answer

'''csv   Prompt,Response
"What is AI?", "AI stands for Artificial Intelligence..."
"Explain neural networks.", "A neural network is..."
'''

📌 Step 2: Fine-Tune GPT Model with transformers

''' python   from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer, Trainer, TrainingArguments, Dataset
import pandas as pd

# Load dataset
df = pd.read_csv("training_data.csv")
dataset = Dataset.from_pandas(df)

# Load pre-trained model
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("gpt2")
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("gpt2")

# Training
training_args = TrainingArguments(output_dir="./fine-tuned", per_device_train_batch_size=2, num_train_epochs=3)
trainer = Trainer(model=model, args=training_args, train_dataset=dataset)
trainer.train()

# Save fine-tuned model
model.save_pretrained("fine-tuned-model")
tokenizer.save_pretrained("fine-tuned-model")
'''


📌 Step 3: Use Fine-Tuned Model in Chatbot Update services/chatbot.py:

''' python   from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer, pipeline

# Load fine-tuned model
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("fine-tuned-model")
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("fine-tuned-model")
chat_model = pipeline("text-generation", model=model, tokenizer=tokenizer)

def generate_response(query):
    return chat_model(query, max_length=100)[0]["generated_text"]
  '''


  👉 Now, your AI chatbot is trained specifically on your documents, making it more accurate! 🎯

Final Thoughts 💡
✅ Streamlit Dashboard → Adds a user-friendly web interface
✅ Docker Compose on VPS → Deploys the project online
✅ LLM Fine-Tuning → Improves chatbot accuracy


1️⃣ Setting Up a VPS for Deployment 🚀
You'll need a VPS (Virtual Private Server) to deploy your AI project online.
A good option is Ubuntu 22.04 on providers like DigitalOcean, AWS, Linode, or Vultr.

🔹 Step 1: Get a VPS
Sign up with a provider and create a VPS with these specs:
✅ Ubuntu 22.04 (or Debian)
✅ At least 2 vCPUs and 4GB RAM (for AI processing)
✅ Public IP Address

After setup, connect via SSH:

sh
Copy
Edit
ssh root@YOUR_VPS_IP
🔹 Step 2: Install Required Software
Run these commands on your VPS to install Docker & Python:

sh
Copy
Edit
# Update system
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y

# Install Docker & Docker Compose
sudo apt install docker docker-compose -y

# Install Python & pip
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip -y
🔹 Step 3: Upload Your Project to the VPS
You need to transfer your project files to the VPS.
Use scp (from your local machine):

sh
Copy
Edit
scp -r /path/to/your_project root@YOUR_VPS_IP:/home/
Or use Git (if your project is on GitHub):

sh
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourproject.git
🔹 Step 4: Run the Project with Docker Compose
Navigate to your project directory on the VPS:

sh
Copy
Edit
cd /home/your_project
Now start the services (FastAPI, Qdrant, Ollama) with Docker Compose:

sh
Copy
Edit
docker-compose up -d --build
This will:
✅ Build the project
✅ Start the chatbot & vector database
✅ Run the FastAPI backend

To check logs:

sh
Copy
Edit
docker-compose logs -f
🔹 Step 5: Expose Your API to the Internet
By default, the API runs on localhost:8000, so we need to allow external access.

📌 Option 1: Expose the Port (Temporary)

sh
Copy
Edit
ufw allow 8000/tcp
Now you can access the API at:

arduino
Copy
Edit
http://YOUR_VPS_IP:8000/docs
📌 Option 2: Use a Reverse Proxy (Recommended for Production)
Install NGINX to serve your API with a domain:

sh
Copy
Edit
sudo apt install nginx -y
Edit the NGINX config:

sh
Copy
Edit
sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/api
Add this config:

nginx
Copy
Edit
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name yourdomain.com;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8000;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    }
}
Save and activate it:

sh
Copy
Edit
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/api /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
sudo systemctl restart nginx
Now your API is accessible at http://yourdomain.com 🎉

2️⃣ Fine-Tuning an LLM for Better Chatbot Responses 🤖
We will fine-tune Mistral-7B using Hugging Face Transformers.

📌 Step 1: Install Dependencies

sh
Copy
Edit
pip install torch transformers datasets accelerate
📌 Step 2: Prepare Training Data (training_data.csv)
Structure:

csv
Copy
Edit
Prompt,Response
"What is AI?", "AI stands for Artificial Intelligence..."
"Explain deep learning.", "Deep learning is a subset of ML..."
📌 Step 3: Fine-Tune a Model (train_llm.py)

python
Copy
Edit
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer, Trainer, TrainingArguments
import pandas as pd
from datasets import Dataset

# Load dataset
df = pd.read_csv("training_data.csv")
dataset = Dataset.from_pandas(df)

# Load base model
model_name = "mistralai/Mistral-7B"
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_name)
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)

# Training config
training_args = TrainingArguments(
    output_dir="./fine_tuned_model",
    per_device_train_batch_size=2,
    num_train_epochs=3,
    logging_dir="./logs"
)

# Train model
trainer = Trainer(model=model, args=training_args, train_dataset=dataset)
trainer.train()

# Save fine-tuned model
model.save_pretrained("fine_tuned_model")
tokenizer.save_pretrained("fine_tuned_model")
📌 Step 4: Use Fine-Tuned Model in Your Chatbot Modify chatbot.py:

python
Copy
Edit
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer, pipeline

# Load fine-tuned model
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("fine_tuned_model")
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("fine_tuned_model")
chatbot = pipeline("text-generation", model=model, tokenizer=tokenizer)

def generate_response(user_query):
    return chatbot(user_query, max_length=150)[0]["generated_text"]
Now your chatbot is smarter and more accurate! 🎯

✅ What We Have Done
✅ Set up a VPS & deployed the API with Docker
✅ Used NGINX as a reverse proxy
✅ Fine-tuned a Large Language Model (LLM)

Do you want help setting up a domain name & SSL certificate? 🔐






You said:
Yes please


ChatGPT said:
Sure! Let's go through the steps to set up a domain name and SSL certificate for your deployed API.

1️⃣ Set Up a Domain Name for Your VPS 🌐
To set up a domain name, you'll need to purchase one from a domain registrar like:

Namecheap

GoDaddy

Google Domains

After purchasing the domain, follow these steps to connect it to your VPS.

Step 1: Set Up DNS Records
Log in to your domain registrar's dashboard.

Find the DNS settings or DNS management section.

Add an A record for your domain to point it to your VPS's public IP.

Here’s what you'll need to do:

Host: @ (or leave blank, depending on the registrar)

Type: A

Value: Your VPS public IP address (e.g., 123.45.67.89)

TTL: 3600 seconds (default)

2️⃣ Set Up SSL Certificate for HTTPS 🔒
For securing the domain with HTTPS, we’ll use Let’s Encrypt to get a free SSL certificate.

Step 1: Install Certbot
On your VPS, install Certbot, the tool that helps with SSL certificate management.

sh
Copy
Edit
sudo apt update
sudo apt install certbot python3-certbot-nginx -y
Step 2: Configure NGINX for SSL
You’ll need to update your NGINX config to handle HTTPS requests and redirect HTTP to HTTPS.

Open your NGINX config file for your API:

sh
Copy
Edit
sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/api
Add the SSL configuration below your existing HTTP settings:

nginx
Copy
Edit
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name yourdomain.com;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8000;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    }

    # Force redirect to HTTPS
    return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
}

server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name yourdomain.com;

    ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/yourdomain.com/fullchain.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/yourdomain.com/privkey.pem;
    ssl_protocols TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3;
    ssl_ciphers 'TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256:TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384';

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8000;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    }
}
Replace yourdomain.com with your actual domain name.

Save and exit the file (press Ctrl + X, then Y to confirm).

Step 3: Obtain SSL Certificate
Use Certbot to automatically obtain and install the SSL certificate for your domain.

sh
Copy
Edit
sudo certbot --nginx -d yourdomain.com
This command will:
✅ Automatically configure SSL for NGINX
✅ Set up HTTPS on your domain
✅ Renew the certificate automatically

You should see a success message that your SSL certificate has been installed.

Step 4: Test the Setup
Once Certbot completes the installation, your website should be available via https://yourdomain.com with SSL encryption.
Open your browser and visit your domain to check the SSL:

Visit https://yourdomain.com

You should see a padlock icon in the browser address bar, confirming that the connection is secure.

3️⃣ Automatically Renew SSL Certificates
Let’s Encrypt certificates expire every 90 days, but Certbot will automatically renew the certificate for you.

To check that the renewal process is working, run this test:

sh
Copy
Edit
sudo certbot renew --dry-run
This will simulate the renewal process, and you should see a success message.

4️⃣ Final Steps
Now that your domain is live with SSL:

Update FastAPI app to use HTTPS.

Make sure that your FastAPI app is aware that requests are now coming via HTTPS.

Test the domain thoroughly:

Open the domain in a browser.

Ensure all HTTP requests are redirected to HTTPS.

Verify that your chatbot is accessible.

🚀 You're Done!
You’ve now successfully set up a domain name and SSL certificate for your AI Document Assistant project on your VPS.

Your project is:

Secure (HTTPS)

Accessible globally

Ready for production
